# PIC

### Preliminary designs and experiments of Parallel Circuits (PC) on Matlab.

### As initially called Parallel Interactive Circuits (PIC), experiments attempted to explore the mutual interactions between circuits.

### Key timeline:
- Sep 15 2014: 
	* Project started.
- Sep 23 2014: 
	* Finished Baseline implementation. 
	* Added momentum.
- Sep 29 2014: 
	* Added RBM-like pre-training.
- Oct 06 2014:
	* Fixed loss plot.
	* Included data normalization.
